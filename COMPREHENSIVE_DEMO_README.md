## üõ†Ô∏è Crawl4AI Features Explained

### 1. Basic Crawling
The foundation of web crawling - fetching and parsing web pages. Crawl4AI handles:
- HTTP requests with automatic retries
- Response parsing and content extraction
- Link discovery and media asset identification
- Metadata extraction (title, description, etc.)

### 2. Deep Crawling
Multi-level crawling that follows links to discover more content:
- Configurable depth limits (1-10 levels)
- Breadth-first exploration of discovered URLs
- Duplicate URL detection and avoidance
- Rate limiting and resource management

### 3. Pagination Handling
Automatic detection and traversal of paginated content:
- Next-link detection
- Numbered pagination traversal
- Infinite scroll simulation
- Custom pagination pattern matching

### 4. AI-Based Extraction
LLM-powered content extraction with custom schemas:
- Structured data extraction using Groq/OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Natural language instructions for content targeting
- JSON schema definition for consistent output
- Intelligent content filtering and organization

### 5. Chunking Strategies
Content segmentation for better processing:
- Semantic chunking based on sentence boundaries
- Regex-based chunking with custom patterns
- Configurable chunk size and overlap
- Content-aware splitting for optimal LLM consumption

### 6. Screenshot Capture
Visual documentation of crawled pages:
- Full-page screenshots
- Viewport customization
- Image format options
- Base64-encoded screenshot data

### 7. JavaScript Execution
Dynamic content loading and interaction:
- Headless browser automation
- Custom JavaScript injection
- Wait conditions for dynamic content
- Event-driven page interaction

### 8. Performance Metrics
Real-time crawling statistics and monitoring:
- Response time tracking
- Success/failure rates
- Content size measurements
- Resource utilization monitoring

## üéØ Using the Web Interface

### Quick Feature Toggles
Enable common features with a single click:
- **Deep Crawl** - Enable multi-level crawling
- **Pagination** - Handle paginated content
- **AI Extraction** - Use LLM for content extraction
- **Screenshot** - Capture page visuals
- **JavaScript** - Execute dynamic content
- **Proxy** - Route requests through proxies

### Advanced Configuration
Fine-tune crawling behavior through the accordion panel:
- **Crawl Strategy** - Choose from Basic, Smart, Magic, Comprehensive, Adaptive, or Deep Discovery modes
- **Extraction Strategy** - Select CSS Selector, LLM Based, or Cosine strategies
- **Chunking Strategy** - Choose Semantic or Regex-based chunking
- **Deep Crawl Settings** - Configure maximum depth and URL limits
- **Pagination Settings** - Select pagination detection method
- **AI Extraction Settings** - Define custom schemas and instructions
- **Manual Extraction** - Specify CSS selectors or XPath expressions
- **Advanced Settings** - Configure wait conditions, user agents, proxies, and sessions

## üîß API Integration

The web interface communicates with a Python backend service that exposes all Crawl4AI features through a REST API:

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `POST /crawl` - Single URL crawling
- `POST /batch-crawl` - Multiple URL crawling
- `POST /analyze-structure` - Page structure analysis
- `POST /test-pagination` - Pagination detection testing

### Request Parameters
The API accepts a comprehensive set of parameters that mirror the Crawl4AI library's capabilities:
- URL and crawling strategy
- Extraction and chunking strategies
- Pagination and deep crawl settings
- JavaScript execution and screenshot options
- Proxy and session management
- Custom CSS selectors and XPath expressions

## üìä Real-Time Monitoring
